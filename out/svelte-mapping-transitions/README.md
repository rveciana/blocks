Third example of a map drawn with Svelte and the d3 projections. Transitions are made now when the mouse is over a region and when the projection is changed.

Check [this blog post from Geoexamples](https://geoexamples.com/other/2019/12/08/mapping-svelte.html) for more explanations.

To test it, clone the standard svelte template by

npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app

And copy the _App.svelte_ and _Feature.svelte_ files into the src directory.
