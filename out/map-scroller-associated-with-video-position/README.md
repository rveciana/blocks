Play the video once loaded to see the example.

I took the idea from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/rveciana/status/759073458932346880).

I created the path with the help of [Geojson.io](geojson.io), and it's not exact. The idea was showing the possibility of syncing the video with the path.

The video is a timelapse (I don't dare driving this fast) taken at the *paradise valley* close to Agadir, Morocco. Go there if you have the opportunity!

The code should be improved. I think that some times don't work if play is pressed beffore the video ends loading.
