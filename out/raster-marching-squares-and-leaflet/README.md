This example shows how to use the [raster-marching-squares](https://github.com/rveciana/raster-marching-squares) library with [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to draw isolines and isobands. Also, converts the GeoTIFF to an interpolated image that is fitted into the map.

More explanations can be found in the [d3js raster tools docs](http://geoexamples.com/d3-raster-tools-docs/plot/leaflet.html) tutorial.

The data is from the GFS model for the Vardah cyclone. [See how the data was generated](http://geoexamples.com/d3-raster-tools-docs/code_samples/vardah.html).
