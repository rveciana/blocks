This map shows the times when muslims are fasting during ramadan along the meridian 30.

The times are calculated using the [PrayTimes](http://praytimes.org/) library, I've taken some ideas from [this block](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4183330) and adjusted the projection using [this other block](http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/10173187).

The times are in local time, so some countries are not in the "natural" timezone. Besides, some countries apply the DST and others don't. The information is taken from these sources:
