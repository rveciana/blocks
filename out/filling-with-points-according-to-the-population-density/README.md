This example, inspired in [this example by Gregor Aisch](http://kartograph.org/showcase/dotgrid/), shows the percentage of people in Catalonia able to speak in Catalan in every *comarca* (data from IDESCAT).

But the Catalan population is not evenly distributed, but concentrated around Barcelona and surroundings. So comparing the region colours can lead to wrong conclusions, since they don't represent comparable amount of people.

So the population density is represented by the dots: The dot area represents the amount of people in each *comarca*
