Learned in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist/status/1120707439999897600?s=19) that Svelte and RxJS work together directly, which I found interesting.

I don't want to forget it, so this example will help me.

[Wired-elements](https://wiredjs.com/) make the example more attractive.

The base is the basic [Svelte template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template). I just changed the App.svelte file and installed the libraries.
