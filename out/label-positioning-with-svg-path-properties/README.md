This example shows how to use [svg-path-properties](https://github.com/rveciana/svg-path-properties) and [d3-marching-squares](https://github.com/rveciana/d3-marching-squares) to draw isolines on a map and label them each certain number of pixels.

There are some issues left, such as avoiding label overlapping.

Read [this other block](http://bl.ocks.org/rveciana/e395f2ef1f872fa69c2182a57e127326) for explanations about the used data and the isolines.
