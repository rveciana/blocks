This an example using the [D3 trail layout](https://github.com/bmschmidt/D3-trail) made by [Benjamin Schmidt](https://github.com/bmschmidt).

The final example, with the typhoon icon moving along the path and the date for each frame shown. This version uses the *coordinates* value instead of *xy*, so paths are drawn instead lines

There is a blog entry explaining this example at [GeoExamples](http://geoexamples.blogspot.com/2014/07/using-d3-trail-layout-to-draw-hayian.html)
