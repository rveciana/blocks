This an example using the [D3 trail layout](https://github.com/bmschmidt/D3-trail) made by [Benjamin Schmidt](https://github.com/bmschmidt).
The example shows how to use the *coordinates* as the *coordType* value.
The track.json data represents the Hayian typhoon track, as it's explained in [this blog entry](http://geoexamples.blogspot.com/2013/12/d3-map-styling-tutorial-i-preparing-data.html).

There is a blog entry explaining this example at [GeoExamples](http://geoexamples.blogspot.com/2014/07/using-d3-trail-layout-to-draw-hayian.html)
