Comparing two files with the congressional districts.

* us_congress.json has better resolution, but some territories are not there: Guam, Marianas and American Samoa
* us_territories has a very coarse resolution, as if a buffer had been aplied to the geometries. Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands are too close.
