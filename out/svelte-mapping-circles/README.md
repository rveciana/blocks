Check [this blog post from Geoexamples](https://geoexamples.com/other/2019/12/08/mapping-svelte.html) for more explanations.

To test it, clone the standard svelte template by

npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app cd svelte-app

And copy the _App.svelte_, _Feature.svelte_ and _cities.js_ files into the src directory.
