Second example of a map drawn with Svelte and the d3 projections. More than one path is created and colored using the d3-scale library.

Check [this blog post from Geoexamples](https://geoexamples.com/other/2019/12/08/mapping-svelte.html) for more explanations.

To test it, clone the standard svelte template by

npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app

And copy the App.svelte file into the src directory.
