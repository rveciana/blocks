This example is an experiment to draw wind barbs using d3js and Canvas.

The data is from a sample WRF model, reprojected from Lambert Conformal to latlon so it can be drawn.

The wind speed is plotted under the barbs, using the [d3-marching-squares](https://github.com/rveciana/d3-marching-squares) library.
