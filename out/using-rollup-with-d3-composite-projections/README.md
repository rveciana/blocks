This example is part of [this blog entry](http://geoexamples.com/d3/2016/10/03/de-composite-projections.html) and shows how to use rollup to create a custom bundle with the library d3-composite-projections.

To use this example, just download the files from the gist

    git clone https://gist.github.com/0e73c92391def44331d2069755edc199.git

and then:

    npm install
    npm run build
