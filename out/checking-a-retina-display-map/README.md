This is an example from the post [Canvas mapping with a retina display](http://geoexamples.com/d3/2017/10/24/canvas-mapping-with-retina.html).

The upper part of the map is not corrected for retins displays and will appear blurred in them, and the lower part is corrected and should appear with sharp edges.

See [the post](http://geoexamples.com/d3/2017/10/24/canvas-mapping-with-retina.html) to learn how to simulate the retina display if your device doesn't have it.
