This an example using the [D3 trail layout](https://github.com/bmschmidt/D3-trail) made by [Benjamin Schmidt](https://github.com/bmschmidt).
In this case, the animated Hayian Typhoon track map is shown, with the colour changing with the typhoon class, as in [this example](http://bl.ocks.org/rveciana/10743959), but in an easier and cleaner way.

There is a blog entry explaining this example at [GeoExamples](http://geoexamples.blogspot.com/2014/07/using-d3-trail-layout-to-draw-hayian.html)
