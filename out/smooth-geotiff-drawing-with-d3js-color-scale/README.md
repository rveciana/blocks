This example shows how to represent a GeoTIFF raster directly into a Canvas object.

The example is identical to [this one](http://bl.ocks.org/rveciana/263b324083ece278e966686d7dba700f), but with another way to create the color scales. This method makes easy to create all the complex color scales needed, and it's taken from the [plotty library](https://github.com/santilland/plotty).

The color scale used here is taken from the [colorbrewer2](http://colorbrewer2.org) site, with the name *RdBu*.
