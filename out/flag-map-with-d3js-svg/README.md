This example belongs to the GeoExamples blog entry [Flag map with D3js](http://geoexamples.blogspot.com/2013/08/flag-map-with-d3js.html).

Basically, gets the flag images from the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_flags) by using [Mike Bostock's queue.js](https://github.com/mbostock/queue) library and adds them to the map.
