Small d3js function to build color scales.

* Append it to an SVG
* Click on the colors to change the color or value
* Delete any color by clicking the icon
* The *change* event triggers when a value or color is changed, so a color scale can be created
* The idea is editing maps like [the one in this example](http://bl.ocks.org/rveciana/3bb56299ecebec0d9c00967cb0759a06) in an interactive way
