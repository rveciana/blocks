This example illustrates this [GeoExamples blog entry](http://geoexamples.blogspot.com/2014/01/d3-map-styling-tutorial-ii-giving-style.html). 

The map is based on the [Kartograph software](http://kartograph.org) example [La Bella Italia](http://kartograph.org/showcase/italia/), made by [Gregor Aisch](http://driven-by-data.net/), and the [D3js example La Belle France](http://bl.ocks.org/rveciana/7711139).

In this case, the filter giving style is better organized and explained in the blog. Basically, the filter stacks a blurred image, a eroded, blurred and substracted image, and the original image.
